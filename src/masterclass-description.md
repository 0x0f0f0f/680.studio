We want offer a refreshing alternative, where you can dive into hands-on
learning with expert instructors who guide you in every step.
The courses usually last from one to three weeks, and both the frequency, duration and content of the courses are fully personalized
and tailored to your needs, availability and existing skill set: **most courses available online are too focused on the basics**. We identify **your strength points and your current bottlenecks, and start from there** instead.
