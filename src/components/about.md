# We are a group of freelance producers and Audio Engineers with a central meeting point: our **[680Hz Studios](https://680.studio)** in **Sch√∂neberg, Berlin**.


We firmly believe that **music is a universal language capable of evoking deep
emotions, thoughts and sensations**,  affecting the human soul, its consciousness and
the body at the same time. Every project we work on, is a new opportunity to discover and reveal
the intrinsic beauty of sound, offering listeners a unique and detailed sensory
journey. **We strive to consolidate strong, personal connections
with our clients**. At **[680Hz Studios](https://680hz.studio)** we are convincend
that the true core of emotions in music stands between the low-medium frequency range,
around the **680Hz** frequency, and the way emotions resonate in people is through
this particular frequency range. In general, by emphasizing, experimenting and
manipulating frequencies you can have an impact on the listeners' perceptions and their
emotional state. This was crucial in our approach to music and workflow behind
all of our projects and collaborations through the years. At our facilities, we guarantee
you music industry standards and the most pleasant human experience.
