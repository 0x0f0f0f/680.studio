# The Frequency of the Soul

At **[680Hz Studios](https://680hz.studio)** we believe
that the true core of emotions in music stands in a specific frequency range, the **low-mid**,
around the **680Hz** frequency, and the way emotions resonate in people is through
this particular frequency range. In general, by emphasizing, experimenting and
manipulating frequencies you can have an impact on the listeners' perceptions and their
emotional state.
