# Every project we work on, is a new opportunity to reveal the intrinsic beauty of sound

Offering listeners a unique and detailed sensory
journey. **We strive to consolidate strong, personal connections
with our clients**. This is crucial in **our approach to music** and our workflow behind
all of our projects and collaborations through the years. At our facilities, we guarantee
music industry standards and the most pleasant human experience.


At **[680Hz Studios](https://680hz.studio)** we believe
that the true core of emotions in music stands in a specific frequency range, the **low-mid**,
around the **680Hz** frequency, and the way emotions resonate in people is through
this particular frequency range. In general, by emphasizing, experimenting and
manipulating frequencies you can have an impact on the listeners' perceptions and their
emotional state.
