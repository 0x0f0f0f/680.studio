This masterclass, inspired by the successful **MIT course** "Computational Thinking with Julia", will guide you through core concepts in algorithms and problem-solving with the versatile [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org).

**Julia’s design makes it the best choice for both beginners and professionals**.
As a multi-paradigm language, it supports functional, object-oriented, and imperative programming, giving you the **flexibility to express thoughts fluently**, whether you’re working in research, industry, or just exploring programming.
You will learn how to combine topics from undergraduate computer science
with Julia’s unique features to express complex ideas fluently within a single programming language,
empowering you to tackle challenges across image processing, audio and video manipulation, scientific modeling, and more.

The content of the masterclass is
personalized to your needs. **This course is project-oriented**: at the beginning of the course, you can pitch your
idea for a project. The goal, is to have a fully functioning **custom Julia software package** at the end of the masterclass,
allowing you to share it with the world and use it in your research or industry projects.

This course is **designed for learners of all levels**. **No prior programming knowledge is required**, although, **if you already know how to code, we can start directly from advanced topics**.
