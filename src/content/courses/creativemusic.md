Whether you're just starting out or already have production experience, this course adapts to your current skill level and takes you **deeper into the art of sound**. Explore **digital and analog synthesizers**, with a focus on **wavetable synthesis**, and learn to design unique instruments. Discover how to creatively use audio effects like reverb, delay, compression, and distortion, and master drum sound design, modulation, resampling, modular and FM synthesis. Dive into creative arrangements, enhanced by foundational music theory that will inform your compositions, and engage in hands-on projects that allow you to apply your skills in real-time. Transform your music with innovative techniques and prepare to take your sound to the next level.

Throughout the masterclass, you will use a DAW of your choice to **create an original track**, allowing you to apply the concepts learned in each session.
As you progress, your track will be revised, and with each lesson we will add new elements and instruments to the track.

This **interactive learning experience** is designed to foster creativity and growth.
This approach not only **solidifies your technical knowledge**, but also results
in **a piece of music that showcases your skills by the end of the course**.
